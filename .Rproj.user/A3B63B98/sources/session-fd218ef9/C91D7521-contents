# Tikaboo Joshua Trees SDD Inference

 
## Introduction
This project infers seed dispersal distance (SDD) with microsatellite data using FRANz pedigree and R markdowns.

[TODO: fill this out]
## Data collection methodology
### Tissue collection
### Microsatellite lab methods

## How to run this project

### Data files
This is made using the following files:
- 'Genotypes.xlsx'
- 'TreeGPS.xlsx'
- 'Morphology.xlsx'
- 'USGS structure assignments.csv'


### Running the code
Run the files as numbered. This requires FRANz pedigree v 1.2.3 to be installed, along with some R packages (tidyverse, readxl, skimr, ggmaps, janitor, geosphere, [TODO: THE ONE FOR SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION])

Note: the version of FRANz is significant, as versions 2.X.X cannot accomodate more than 30(?) specimens.
