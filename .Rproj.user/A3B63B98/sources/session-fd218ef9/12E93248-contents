# 1 - initial data reading/setup

## setup
setting up required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(ggmap)
```

## Reading in data
Genotypes contains our microsatellite data, coords, contains our tree coordinates.
```{r}
genotypes <- read_xlsx('data-files/Genotypes.xlsx')
dim(genotypes)
coords <- read_xlsx('data-files/TreeCoordinates.xlsx')
dim(coords)

```

Now we have to do some cleaning of the data. This starts with converting the formatting of the longitude and latitude to decimal format.
```{r}
head(coords)

# for some reason Lat is reading as a character so..
coords <- coords %>% mutate(Lat = as.numeric(Lat))

# need to make the coordinates into decimal form instead of minutes
coords <- coords %>%
  mutate(Y = (Lat + `Lat '`/60), X = -(Long + `Long '`/60)) %>%
  unique()
head(coords$Y)
head(coords$X)
```
And now cleaning up the genotype data. The ID is currently being read in as numeric, which isn't best practices. There are also some duplicated rows.
```{r}
head(genotypes)
# id is currently numeric so probably better to make it char to be safe
genotypes <- genotypes %>%
  mutate(`Sample id` = as.character(`Sample id`), ) %>%
  rename("fil36 Allele#1" = "Fil36 Allele#1") %>% # fixing capitalization of column
  unique() # were duplicates of rows so added this
```

[TODO: add more data/ initial exploration to characterize the data?]

## Preliminary mapping visualization
NOTE: in order for the ggmaps functions below to function, you will need to register an API key in the R console using ```register_google("API_KEY")```.
This sort of key is a static map key[TODO: hyperlink to the google api page], which has free unlimited usages. Still, best security practices dictate not sharing API keys.
```{r}
# [TODO: delete this key when uploading to github AIzaSyCOTXxcPzKTjJCub58MglbKZxeHvSAKFvY]

geno_coords <- inner_join(genotypes, coords, by = c("Tree" = "Tree"))
dim(geno_coords)

# 3 duplicates.. might have been left over from not joining after fixing other
# duplicate entries
geno_coords <- unique(geno_coords)

```

```{r}

```
