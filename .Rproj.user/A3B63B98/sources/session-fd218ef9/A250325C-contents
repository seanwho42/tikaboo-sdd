# 2 - franz formatting
## Description
This code reads in the genotype data in as excel files and creates a file which can be read by FRANz pedigree

## setup
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(janitor)
```

## reading data
```{r}

franz_genotypes <- genotypes %>%
  select(-`Sample id`) %>%
  mutate(Tree = paste("    ", Tree, " 1 ? ? ?", sep = "")) 
  # adding 4 spaces to meet 10 length requirement for input file
  # then adding the columns that aren't relevant
```
We've read in the data and added some more information required for FRANz runs to each of the runs. [TODO explain what that is]

## Merging alleles
The next step for formatting is to combine alleles for each loci, so that each pair of alleles is saved in one column, separated by a slash.
```{r}

franz_genotypes_slashes <- franz_genotypes %>%
  mutate(
    yb01 = paste(`yb01 Allele#1`, "/", `yb01 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb15 = paste(`yb15 Allele#1`, "/", `yb15 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb21 = paste(`yb21 Allele#1`, "/", `yb21 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb04 = paste(`yb04 Allele#1`, "/", `yb04 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb06 = paste(`yb06 Allele#1`, "/", `yb06 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb12 = paste(`yb12 Allele#1`, "/", `yb12 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb13 = paste(`yb13 Allele#1`, "/", `yb13 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    fil36 = paste(`fil36 Allele#1`, "/", `fil36 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb08 = paste(`yb08 Allele#1`, "/", `yb08 Allele#2`, sep=""),
    yb22 = paste(`yb22 Allele#1`, "/", `yb22 Allele#2`, sep="")
    )
names(franz_genotypes_slashes)

# selecting the columns we actually need
franz_genotypes_slashes <- franz_genotypes_slashes %>% select("Tree","yb01","yb15","yb21","yb04","yb06","yb12","yb13","fil36","yb08","yb22")

```

## Removing clones from our data
Although the formatting is mostly ready to go, we still have to do some more cleaning of our data.

Before we run FRANz pedigree, we want to remove clones from our data to avoid confusions in the pedigree inference. Let's take a look to see how many are cloned.
```{r}
franz_genotypes_slashes %>%
  # add a boolean column to signify cloned data
  mutate(cloned = duplicated(franz_genotypes_slashes%>%select(-Tree))) %>%
  # filtering for cloned results only
  filter(cloned==T) %>%
  # filtering by a coupe of the alleles so that the clones show up together regardless of their tree IDs
  arrange(yb01,yb15,Tree)
```
This shows all non-original rows, ignoring the tree ID. Looking at the last four entries, all of which are missing any genetic data, this means that there was one tree before TV2301 which had no genetic data. So, each of the four after that got marked as duplicates.

[TODO: check all cloned data to figure out if they are actually nearby each other and, therefore, interchangeable, i.e. does methodology picking each tree matter when filtering out clones]
```{r}

```


Now, lets actually remove these clones.
```{r}
# just going to remove the clones to make it simpler
franz_cloneless <- franz_genotypes_slashes %>%
  filter(!duplicated(franz_genotypes_slashes %>% select(-Tree)))

franz_cloneless %>% head()
franz_cloneless %>% dim()
# now making rough franz input file for this

?write_delim
franz_cloneless %>% write_delim("franz-files/franz_cloneless_rough.dat", delim=" ", quote='none', col_names=FALSE)

```

Now we've created the rough text file which will be used for the franz reads. This needs some further manual formatting and to be made into a .dat file.


Here are changes that were made because of errors running FRANz:
- TV4284 ?/217 changed to ?/?
- TV3034 122.5 changed to ?
- Removed TV5188 and TV5087

[TODO: include reasons why -- think that 217 was made to ? because it didnt fit with the tandem repeat pattern and threw errors because of it, decimal is obvious, and 5188 and 5087 I'm not sure]

This following header was added to create the .dat file:
```{}
1 10 / cloneless
697 tikaboo
```
This signifies:
```{}
???, # of loci, allele deliminator character, name???
# of samples, ???
```

Additionally, the file was renamed to "franz_cloneless.dat"
[TODO: fully/further explain what exactly the 1, cloneless, and tikaboo signify]

## Running in FRANz
```{}
Franz was run with the following command within the folder franz-files:
FRANz --Nmax 10000 --selfing --poutformat 2 --pedigreeoutformat 1,2,3 franz_cloneless.dat
```
