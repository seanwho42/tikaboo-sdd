# 1 - initial data reading/setup

## setup
setting up required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggmap)
# library(spdep) [TODO: isn't installing]
```

## Reading in data
For spatial autocorrelation, we're going to analyze a few things. One of which is morphology data, which we haven't read in yet. This is in 'data-files/Morphology.csv'
[TODO: make sure this is the most complete version of our morphology data]

```{r}
morphology <- read_csv('data-files/Morphology.csv') %>% clean_names() %>% unique()
head(morphology)
summary(morphology)
```
Now let's join this to our coordinate data. There's need to connect this to genotype data, as this is separate analysis.
```{r}
morph_coords = inner_join(morphology, coords, by=c('tree'='Tree')) %>% select(tree, X, Y, height)
summary(morph_coords)
```
