# poppr

## setup
setting up required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(ggmap)
library(poppr)
```

##
```{r}
poppr_genotypes
```

Now we have to check the genotype accumulation cruve to check how much power we have to discriminate between individuals
```{r}
genotype_curve(poppr_genotypes, sample = 1000, quiet = TRUE)
```
We can get some summary information about the loci
```{r}
# note that we have cut yb05 and yb20
locus_table(poppr_genotypes)
```

And we can find percent missing for each locus here
```{r}
info_table(poppr_genotypes, type = "missing")
```



```{r}
?clonecorrect
clonecorrect(poppr_genotypes)
```
